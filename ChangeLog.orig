	  of a few things to improve that.

    o Serious trim to /etc/protocols
    o RL/4, route script mod.
    o iptables was installing a man page :) (Thanks to Bruno LFC)
    o Removed cardctl && probe from image. (Bruno on the former again)
    o Clean up ==> bug in prism2_param shell script
    o Start hacking in WDS stuff (mesh)
    o Fixed another Web page problem with %xx translation, left
      out the hex digits A-F,a-f ... Oops.

2002-08-13
    o update program will now reliably reboot the box *every*
        time.  Coded in system call.

2002-08-10
    o Per Jaron Wilks, Cleanup 21iptables script, forgot a POSTROUTING
      flag.
    o Added chmod to busybox.  RL/5 wants to see executables in
      /etc/rw/5 directory.  Current set would have required dragging
      it from elsewhere, or copying && modifying one of the scripts
      already on the system.  Heheheh :)
    o For JW: Added a call to 'tweak'.  If there is an 'x' called
      rc.tweak in /etc/rw it will get run after everything else.
    o Fixup's and cleanups to startup scripting.
    o Cleanup somewhat && testing of web configuration.  Still ugly but
      it works.
    o Creation of 'diffs' for source tree to split out linux-2.4.17
    o Elimintate deref of include/linux include/asm files from uclibc,
      this eliminates the 'chicken & egg' of linux/autoconf.h for one.
      of course wiping out the linux dir will be problematical :).
    o Added --noinhibit-exec to arch/i386/Makefile ld string to get
        around  errors with the new binutils.  -- Ugly Hack! Danger
        Will Robinson, Danger.
    o Added apply_patches script to patch kernel.

    o Move RL5 to RL6 ... flash && reboot default for sram image
    o Make dir for runlevel 5 a symlink to ../rw/5 this

        and nbd/swap
    o re-worked the rc code to use single 'netcfg' file
        with primary/secondary interface info in it
    o Moved rw.default out of Image_static to RW.default
        and plugged it into the build_flash.pl script
    o Placed cramfs-patch and nfs-swap patch in misc

2002-06-09 Keith Smith <keith@ksmith.com>

            o hacked telnetd to use /etc/telnetd.hosts as a
                one line at a time access list with matching
                to a octet dot
            o added rdate
            o removed wget
            o Added tftp, it's less flexible but
                < 1/3 the size (you can put it back in Config.h)
            o reduced a buffer in syslog for filename to 128.

        - ciped  hacked in CIPE-1.5.2

            o Added NFS swapping patch.
        - misc
            o Modified kernel_config files
        - nbd  added nbd 2.0 utils
        - pcmcia-cs
            o Modified Links for new prism2 code

                would not allow a 1 IP address range (from and
                to the same IP), I think it was the last # listed
                would never be given out.
        - wireless_tools  updated to version 24
            o Hacked Makefile as before
            o install iwpriv also (for WEP prism2_param)
