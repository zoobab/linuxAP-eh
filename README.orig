Once again, this is the latest linuxAP (formerly openSTA) software.  You
can always download the latest from:

http://linuxAP.ksmith.com

It's still probably a good idea to put this in /usr/src/linuxAP.  I've
made a great deal of effort to keep things non-specific but some of this
stuff is really onrey.

QuickStart

Extract the bundle (you've already done this probably)

cd linuxAP
mkdir tarfiles
cd tarfiles
--> Place the following files in here
    bridge-utils-0.9.6.tar.gz
    busybox-0.60.5.tar.bz2
 *  cipe-1.5.4.tar.gz 
 *  cku206.tar.gz
    cramfs-1.1.tar.gz
    hostap-2002-10-12.tar.bz2
 *  iptables-1.2.7a.tar.bz2
    linux-2.4.20.tar.bz2
    pcmcia-cs-3.2.3.tar.bz2
 *  syslinux-2.00.tar.bz2
    uClibc-0.9.12.tar.bz2
    udhcp-0.9.8.tar.gz
    wireless_tools.25.tar.gz

--> Files with a * are optional
cd ..
make
<configure what you want>
make

WL11000-SAN
-----------

WL11000 uses 4800/8/N/1 on the serial port, hook it up with a null modem
to minicom or the like.  Crazy busybox/uClibc plays hell with the modem
control lines, use no flow control


To install fresh to a new AP
----------------------------
Copy the sram file to a linear pcmcia RAM card.

Boot the sram card by shorting JP2

Watch the boot on the serial port, watch the eeprom update.  The machine
will reboot, then fail for lack of the radio card. 


To update a flashed AP
----------------------
Copy 'flash' && 'flash.md5' to your tftp directory

reflash -s flash {your tftp host IP}


Soekris
-------

Serial console is set to 19200/N/8/1.  Use minicom uClibc/busybox play
hell with the modem control lines.

Create a dos partition (~8MB) on an ATA/CF card
Put syslinux on it, mount it on /cf

copy kernel->/cf/linux
copy ramdisk->/cf/ramdisk
copy syslinux.cfg -> /cf/syslinux.cfg

Slide it in the soekris.

I changed the build dramatically.  I now use the kernel config parser
and a config.in file to configure what we are going to build

****IMPORTANT****

If you are changing from one build target to another you MUST run make
distclean and start fresh first.  I'll work on that.
